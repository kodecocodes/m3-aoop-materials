  TODO: This can be multiple lines. Just be sure to maintain the indent on
  subsequent lines. This appears below the episode on the video page, and
  should include as much context as possible, to allow subscribers, non-subscribers
  and search engines to understand what is included in the video. You can
  use markdown. Do not just replicate the short_description.
short_description: |
  TODO: Maintain the indent on subsequent lines and don't exceed 160 characters. This 
  is short and needs to include the salient information about the episode. This is used for the meta description on the video page.
authors_notes_md: |
  TODO: For first episode, include prerequisites for course. This is visible to viewers on the site, should include details that are useful to the viewer, but that don't fit in the description. You can use markdown. 
  You can leave this field empty, but don't delete the attribute on any of the episodes.

# Introduction

Use `$[//]` anywhere on the line to omit the line from transcript (for example for editor notes, comments for yourself or for slide labels). More information in the [Instructor Resources Repo](https://github.com/kodecocodes/vdd-resources).
Remove these two lines, and write your script.

# Course Questionnaire

This file has several questions that, when answered by you, will help us create the marketing emails for your course.

Please answer the questions with as much detail as possible, as this really helps us create useful emails for our audience. Don't worry about writing too much - we can always edit it down!

## Why should people take your course? Explain what benefits this course will offer students. Please try to write something that isn't already on the course homepage :]

[TODO: Your answer here]

## How do you use [course topic] in your job? Briefly explain some of the cool/complex stuff you’re doing in your job, and show how the techniques taught in your course are helpful……OR…..if this question does not apply to you, answer one of: A) How can this course help with a common pain point? B) What surprised you about this topic when making the course?

## Can you please share a cool tip, related to your course topic, with us? (Is there any cool idea you can share from your course in a brief code snippet and 1-2 paragraphs of explanation?)

[TODO: Your answer here]

## Is there anything else you'd like to share about your course topic, that you think our students would benefit from hearing? Again, please try to avoid using something that is already on the course homepage :]

[TODO: Your answer here]

## By default, we will use your Kodeco profile picture in the email. Please let us know if there's another profile picture that you'd prefer we use.
